New Power Coin Desktop Wallet with Online Advertising
============================

This desktop wallet is mainly designed to provide a new form of **advertising service** for users who use the wallet for managing masternodes and winning PoS rewards. In addition, the wallet is more friendly for beginners compared to the [Qt version wallet](https://github.com/NPW-Project/NewPowerCoin).

When the user runs the wallet to receive masternode and staking rewards, he or she can choose whether to display the advertisement provided by the advertisement platform. If the user allows the advertisement to display, the advertisement platform will automatically send a certain amount of NPW rewards to this wallet.

The wallet's main functions are listed as follow:

- A wallet that can manage your assets and send/receive NPW or zerocoin zNPW;
- A advertising end-client that is used to watch advertisement and receive rewards;
- A blockchain node with PoS mining;
- Setup and manage masternode with some clicks;
- Display information about masternodes, supply, price, market, etc;
